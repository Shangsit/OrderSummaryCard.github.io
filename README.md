### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

- At first, I made a picture of the layout in a paper, and tried to figure out the html tags that I will be using.
- Then I divided the project into 3 major sections, as top, middle and bottom.
- Also, I subdivided the bottom section for the payment section. 
- Then I started styling each of the sections.
- At the end, I started for setting the background
- This was the most difficult part for me, as I had to put an image as well as a color to the background.
- Then after a lot of brainstorming, I figured it out.
- I put the background color in the whole body.
- And then made another div and put all the elements inside it, and put the background color in it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
The biggest thing I learned was to add background image and background color at the same time.
I am proud of the following code that I have written.
```html```
<body>
    <div id="background">
        <div id="body">
          <!-- The body code -->
        </div>
    </div>
  <!-- The footer code -->
 </body>
 Then I provided color to body(not the id) and image to the background(id).
